The gods have been debating whether or not to snatch away Hector's body to aid the Trojans. Hera does not like this idea and is arguing with Apollo, leading to a comparison of Hector and Achilles, pointing out Hector's mortality.

Hector is but mortal and suckled at a woman breast.

τοῦτο ἔνιοι τῶν κριτικῶν κατ συνωνυμίαν μεταλαμβάνουσι μεταλαμβανοντες λέγοντες αὐτον εἶναι γυναῖκα καὶ ἄνθρωπον καὶ θνητόν, ὡς γίνεσθαι τοιοῦτον. Ἕκτωρ μὲν θνητὸς θνητὸν τε θήσατο μαζον ἄλλοι δὲ παρειλῆφθαι τὸ γυναῖκα ἀντι τοῦ κτητικοῦ γυναικεῖον· τοὺς δὲ Ἀττικοὺς καὶ Δωριέας τοῖς κυριωτέροις χρῆσθαι ἀντι κτητικων Ἕλληνα στρατὸν ἀντι Ἑλληνικον καὶ ανον ῆθος ἀντι τοῦ ανινον καὶ Ἑλλάδα διάλεκτον

Some critics are saying that "woman," "human," and "mortal" are synonomous but others, including the Attics and the Dorics, are saying that it is more proper for γυναῖκα to be in the possessive (genitive) form. Examples: Greek person army vs. Greek army; person custom vs. human custom; Greece dialect vs. Greek dialect.

ἡ διπλῆ, ὅτι ἀντι τοῦ γυναικὸς μαζόν Ὁμηρικὸν δὲ τὸ εθος ὣς τὴν μὲν πρύμνην ἄμφεπε

The diplae because instead of the possessive it is Homeric custom to be 'the woman the breast'. Example: 'the back the fire' (Iliad 16.124)
